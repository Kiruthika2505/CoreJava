What is Java?
	- Java is a High level , object -oriented Programming langauage.


High level - Human understandable code/program(AlphaNumeric)
Assembly level - Mnemonic code(commands)
Low Level - Machine Level langauge(Computer undertsandable language - 0's and 1's)


Cobol,Pascal,C,C++, Java , Python - High Level language

Basic - Assemble langauge

What is programming?

The art of creating programs to fulfill the needs of a computer and human being.

What is program?
Set of instructions which is used to perform a specific task.


Object Oriented - Real world objects are mapped into program
Example:

Mysore - Object - Place

 	- name 
	- attribute
	- function


class Mysore
{
		String Trainpath,BusRoute;
		Double Airpath;

		void BusRoute(int km,float speed,float time)
		{

		}

		void train(int km,float speed,float time)
		{

		}
}



Object : Superstar

	class Rajini
	{
			String color = dusky;
			float height = 5.11;
			float weight = 75.2;

			walking();			
			talking();
			dancing();
	}



JDK - Java Development Kit - Software tool

BIN:

	- JRE (Java RunTime Environment) - Java Virtual Machine
			javac - Java Compiler - Convert High level language into bytecode(Machine Independent) .class file
			java  - Java Interpreter - Convert bytecode to machine code( it check & executes code line by line)

	- API (application programming interface) - consist of collection of packages and classes for compiling &
 executing java program

LIB:
classess & Packages

code - constant,variables,keywords,functions,operators,control statement,looping, style,.

 program:

		input : data
		process: data
		output: data

data?
	raw information (fact), 

data type:

The type of value stored in a variable(data) and the size used to representation.
